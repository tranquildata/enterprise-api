      summary: Returns a computed query for the given variables and assertions.
      description: >
        When a peer is run using the `consume` command it will read the contents of the change data capture stream and write
        an indexed data-set into a SQL database. This API call returns efficient queries over that SQL schema that are "computed"
        based on the domain's policy to return only the data valid for a given set of constraints. A constraint might be a
        specific purpose, a geographic region, a named contract, etc. The query provided is known to return identifiers for 
        the records that would satisfy record-based policy evaluation. The `GET` form is provided as a purposefully simple
        interface that takes a single variable for common, one-off use. The body of the response will contain either the full,
        computed SQL query or an explaination of any error.
